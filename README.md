# AlgorithmsAndDataStudy
This repo demonstrates how to implement many common data structures and algorithms. It's main purpose was for my learning, but you may be able to learn something too!

## Data Strucutures
To learn how they work (and sharpen my programming skills), I implemented the below data structures and used them to solve problems. I put most of them through their paces with automated testing, too.
### Implemented in Kotlin
- ArrayList
- String and StringBuilder
- Vector
- Graph (adjacency list and adjacency matrix)
- Heap (min and max)
- LinkedList
- HashMap
- HashSet
- TreeMap
- Queue
- Priority queue (using a heap)
- Stack
- Tree (AVL and Red-Black)
- Trie

### Implemented in Java
- HashTable
- Max heap
- LinkedList (singly and doubly linked)
- Queue
- Stack
- Tree (binary and binary search)

## Algorithms and practice problems
I implemented the most common sorting algorithms (heap sort, quick sort, etc), and even more while completing some practice questions (such as topological sort).
